Our example broken in to modules. This time we added versions of different modules.

Takeaway:

- Nothing. This was pretty obvious ;)

Problem:

- Won't it make my app slow to import a ton of modules?
- Dependency/version management won't scale.

Solution:

- Many modules: serve with HTTP/2!
- Dependency/version management: Use importmaps.
