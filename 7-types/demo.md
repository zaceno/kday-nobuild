Our example app using hyperapp, tag-functions and type-safety with jsdoc syntax.

Takeaway

- JSDoc syntax is clunky
- JSDoc does not support all features of typescript (notably: function overloading)
- Intellisense / TSC understands JSDoc syntax
- We get type-safety as we code, and our code still runs in browsers.

That's all folks!

- Have a look at 8-todomvc for a more realistic demo of these techniques together.
- Play around with it and see what you like/don't like about it.
- Think about how some of these ideas might impact your work as a front-end coder.
